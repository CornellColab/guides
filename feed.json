As you continue to learn, plan, and take your first actions, the threat model becomes a touchstone that can help you decide which defenses are  worthwhile for you.</p>\n<p><a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.eff.org/files/2020/01/06/threatmodeling-onepager.pdf\" href=\"https://www.eff.org/files/2020/01/06/threatmodeling-onepager.pdf\">Risk Assessment one-pager</a>, Electronic Frontier Foundation (2019).</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--info\">For background reading to help inform your threat model, see the section Understanding Harassment below. </p>\n<h2>Secure Your Accounts</h2>\n<p>Ideally, <em>each</em> of your accounts will have a unique, hard-to-guess password. Creation and storage of most of these passwords are best left to a password manager.</p>\n<p>But for your most important accounts, you may want to create your own memorable, strong passwords, and keep them out of your password manager. You may also want to enable two-factor authentication for these most important accounts. </p>\n<p>Don't forget to create a strong, memorable password for your password manager itself!</p>\n<h3>Create Strong Passwords</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/creating-strong-passwords\">How to Create Strong Passwords</a>, Electronic Freedom Foundation (2021)</p>\n<h3>Choose and Maintain a Password Manager</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/why-you-need-a-password-manager-yes-you/\">Why You Need a Password Manager.

Cunningham (2021). <em>Wirecutter: The New York Times</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://haveibeenpwned.com/\">Have I Been Pwned?</a> A safe, free tool that allows you to see if your email address(es) has been a username in any known credential hacks.</p>\n<p>Choose a password manager, and install it on all your devices. Here are three easy-to-use options:</p>\n<h5>Bitwarden</h5>\n<aside class=\"post__note\">\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://bitwarden.com/\">Bitwarden Sign Up</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://bitwarden.com/help/\">Official Help Docs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzuut0-noHk\">An unofficial video introduction</a></li>\n</ul>\n</aside>\n<p><em><strong>Pros</strong></em><em> </em>Open source. Well-designed and easy to use.

No customer passwords were accessed.). </p>\n<p><em><strong>Cost</strong></em>: Free Personal plan or Family plan for Cornell affiliates.<br>After Cornell affiliation ends: Free for one individual and <em>one device, </em>$36/yr for full-featured individual plan, $48/yr for families.</p>\n<h3>Enable Multi-Factor Authentication</h3>\n<p>For your most important or most sensitive accounts, consider enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) with an authenticator app, a hardware token -- or both, which lets each act as a backup for the other.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--warning\">The easiest and often default 2FA method is plain text SMS. But this is also the least secure method, as a determined adversary can spoof your phone number if they know it, and intercept plain SMS texts. That's why we recommend an authenticator app or hardware token. </p>\n<h5><strong>Authenticator Apps</strong></h5>\n<p>Authenticator apps are free for individual end users (like you) because their profit comes from the tech companies that pay for them to be compatible with their sites, and by enterprise customers (like Cornell).</p>\n<p>Authenticator apps explained: <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/22419794/authenticator-apps-and-you-authy-google-authenticator\">There's a Better Way to Protect Yourself from Hackers and Identity Thieves</a>, S. Morrison (2021). <em>Vox recode.</em></p>\n<p>You probably already use one authenticator app -- Duo Mobile -- to access your Cornell account. <a href=\"https://guide.duo.com/third-party-accounts\">Follow these instructions to add additional third-party accounts to Duo Mobile</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://authy.com\">Authy</a> is another free and trustworthy authenticator app. <br>Some 3rd-party password managers also offer authenicator apps. </p>\n<h5><strong>Authentication with a Hardware Token</strong></h5>\n<p>A hardware token is the most secure form of 2FA. It's a small physical item that looks slightly like a thumb drive. Keep it with you -- on your keychain, for example -- and plug it into your device's USB or Lightning drive when you need authentication. It's particularly useful if you need 2FA access when you don't have reliable cellular service, or if you use burner phones.</p>\n<p>Hardware tokens explained: <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-use-a-yubikey/\">Simplify and Secure Your Online Accounts with a Yubikey</a>, J Colt (2018). <em>WIRED.</em></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.yubico.com/\">Yubikey</a> is the most popular brand of authenticator hardware token</p>\n<h2>Data Brokers</h2>\n<h3>Remove Your Details from Data Broker Storehouses</h3>\n<p>DIY: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nJS9LJV7QCxl2d6DcTuao_lPfeT2gYgfWpvRzpSUEwU/edit?pli=1\">Reanna's Big List of data brokers and their opt-out links</a></p>\n<p>If you decide to hire a service: <a href=\"https://joindeleteme.com/\">DeleteMe</a></p>\n<h3>Plug Some Leaky Data Holes</h3>\n<p>Install tracking blocker extensions on your web browsers, like <a href=\"https://privacybadger.org/\">Privacy Badger</a> or <a href=\"https://ublockorigin.com/\">uBlock Origin</a>.</p>\n<p>Delete apps from your phone that you don't need.</p>\n<p>Follow t<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/19/opinion/location-tracking-privacy-tips.html\">hese steps for limiting location tracking on your phone</a>.

Curtis</p>\n<h3>University Websites &amp; Personal Websites</h3>\n<p>Do you want a photo on your department website? Do you want your campus address posted on university or personal websites?</p>\n<p>If you maintain a personal website, use a contact form rather than publishing your personal email address.</p>\n<p>If you have a personal website, be sure to keep security patches updated. Or, build your site using a static site generator; static sites are more resistant to denial-of-service attacks and other attempts to cause harm. Talk to Digital CoLab staff for help with building a static site. </p>\n<h3>Your Academic Work</h3>\n<p>Be aware that your email correspondence with colleagues at state universities may be obtained and published via public records requests.</p>\n<p>Consider adding a copyright statement to your syllabus that prohibits students' posting course materials publicly. <a href=\"https://theuniversityfaculty.cornell.edu/dean/academic-integrity/students-buying-and-selling-course-materials/\">This Faculty Senate page offers suggested language</a>. If you find your work posted on third party sites, you can request removal. Cornell Library Copyright Services offers <a href=\"https://guides.library.cornell.edu/copyright/course-material\">a guide for finding re-posted course material and requesting its removal. </a></p>\n<h3>Early Warning System</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/4815696?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Set up a Google alert for your name</a>, so that you will have a heads-up if you become a target.</p>\n<p>Proactively request colleagues and family not share your contact information or personal details with cold callers or e-mailers. Consider speaking with your departmental administrative staff, and with anyone who is connected with your name in your academic work, or who you find linked to you in data-broker records.</p>\n<h2>Plan in Advance: <br>How To Respond in the Event of an Attack</h2>\n<p>Is there a friend you would trust to screen your email for you, so that you don't have to read the messages in the moment? Talk to them in advance.</p>\n<p>Who in your personal or professional networks could you tap to report social media abuse? Threatening posts have a better chance of being taken down if reported by someone other than the target.</p>\n<p>Will you want to save abusive materials in order to have documentation later?</p>\n<p>Consider starting a conversation with colleagues in your unit or department about the collective harm of targeted and network harassment. As a group, consider how you might respond collectively, or not, to cases of sustained and severe harassment.</p>\n<p>Consider contacting <a href=\"https://health.cornell.edu/services/victim-advocacy\">Cornell Health's Victim Advocacy Program</a> for mental health and other support.</p>\n<h2>Collective Harms &amp; Collective Responses</h2>\n<p>It's important to remember that, while the largest burden of targeted or networked harassment is borne by individuals, the goal of such harassment is to discredit and delegitimize higher education, the academy, the research process, academic freedom, and academic institutions <em>collectively. </em></p>\n<p>Therefore, the problem can never be solved by individual responses alone. Here are some resources to consider if you are planning collective defenses with your department, professional organization, or other group. </p>\n<p>The American Association of University Professors (AAUP), informed by years of research and practice, <a href=\"https://www.aaup.org/news/targeted-online-harassment-faculty#.YU_bI6ApDfY\">recommends </a>clear and forceful condemnations of harassment and intimidation from institutions, boards, and faculties, individually and collectively.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://facultyfirstresponders.com/responding-as-an-administrator/\">How Should Administrators Respond to a Campus Reform Story?</a> I.
