Generally, there's no way to have your information removed from these websites, but you <em>can</em> <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/9673730?hl=en">request that Google remove search results from these sites in its rankings</a>. Results of these requests may vary, but it's worth a try. </span></p><p>Another way to push down harasser-created results is to make sure there is plenty of good, recent information out there about you on high-quality websites. In other words, you don't want to disappear from the web. Examples include: well-curated social media profiles, your Cornell faculty page, news articles and press releases. Work with your Cornell university relations contact to help. </p><p>Remember that you do not control any data about your digital activities and communication that is created on an employer-owned device, or with employer-licensed software, such as Zoom, Box, Microsoft 365, etc. </p><h3>Background Reading on Data Brokers</h3><h5><strong>Public-Facing Data Brokers</strong></h5><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/15/technology/personaltech/i-shared-my-phone-number-i-learned-i-shouldnt-have.html">I Shared My Phone Number.

But this is also the least secure method, as a determined adversary can spoof your phone number if they know it, and intercept plain SMS texts. That's why we recommend an authenticator app or hardware token. </p><h5><strong>Authenticator Apps</strong></h5><p>Authenticator apps are free for individual end users (like you) because their profit comes from the tech companies that pay for them to be compatible with their sites, and by enterprise customers (like Cornell).</p><p>Authenticator apps explained: <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22419794/authenticator-apps-and-you-authy-google-authenticator">There's a Better Way to Protect Yourself from Hackers and Identity Thieves</a>, S.

It's a small physical item that looks slightly like a thumb drive. Keep it with you -- on your keychain, for example -- and plug it into your device's USB or Lightning drive when you need authentication. It's particularly useful if you need 2FA access when you don't have reliable cellular service, or if you use burner phones.</p><p>Hardware tokens explained: <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-use-a-yubikey/">Simplify and Secure Your Online Accounts with a Yubikey</a>, J Colt (2018). <em>WIRED.</em></p><p>The <a href="https://www.yubico.com/">Yubikey</a> is the most popular brand of authenticator hardware token</p><h3>Personal Websites</h3><p>If you maintain a personal website, use a contact form rather than publishing your personal email address.</p><p>If you have a personal website, be sure to keep security patches updated. Or, build your site using a static site generator; static sites are more resistant to denial-of-service attacks and other attempts to cause harm. Talk to Digital CoLab staff for help with building a static site. </p><h3>Your Academic Work</h3><p>Be aware that your email correspondence with colleagues at state universities may be obtained and published via public records requests.</p><p>If you maintain a profile on a third-party host of preprints/postprints, be cautious with commercial surveillance sites such as Academia and ResearchGate. Instead, consider repositories and networks built, owned, and maintained by scholarly communities, such as <a href="https://orcid.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OrcID</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ArXiv</a>, <a href="https://hcommons.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Humanities Commons</a>, <a href="https://ecommons.cornell.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eCommons</a>, or others in your field. </p><p>When a library database vendor pushes you to create an account while using it, avoid doing so, unless you have a specific reason for wanting to do so. </p><p>Consider adding a copyright statement to your syllabus that prohibits students' posting course materials publicly. <a href="https://theuniversityfaculty.cornell.edu/dean/academic-integrity/students-buying-and-selling-course-materials/">This Faculty Senate page offers suggested language</a>. If you find your work posted on third party sites, you can request removal. Cornell Library Copyright Services offers <a href="https://guides.library.cornell.edu/copyright/course-material">a guide for finding re-posted course material and requesting its removal.</a></p><h3>Early Warning System</h3><p><a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/4815696?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Set up a Google alert for your name</a>, so that you will have a heads-up if you become a target.</p><p>Proactively request colleagues and family not share your contact information, schedule, or other personal details with cold callers or e-mailers. Speak with:</p><ul><li>Departmental faculty and staff</li><li>Anyone who is connected with your name in your academic work</li><li>Anyone (usually family members or roommates) who you find linked to you in data-broker records</li></ul><h2>Plan in Advance:<br>How To Respond in the Event of an Attack</h2><p>Is there a friend you would trust to screen your email for you, so that you don't have to read the messages in the moment? Talk to them in advance.</p><p>Who in your personal or professional networks could you tap to report social media abuse? Threatening posts have a better chance of being taken down if reported by someone other than the target.</p><p>Will you want to save abusive materials in order to have documentation later?</p><p>Consider starting a conversation with colleagues in your unit or department about the collective harm of targeted and network harassment. As a group, consider how you might respond collectively, or not, to cases of sustained and severe harassment.</p><p>Consider contacting <a href="https://health.cornell.edu/services/victim-advocacy">Cornell Health's Victim Advocacy Program</a> for mental health and other support.</p><h2>Collective Harms &amp; Collective Responses</h2><p>It's important to remember that, while the largest burden of targeted or networked harassment is borne by individuals, the goal of such harassment is to discredit and delegitimize higher education, the academy, the research process, academic freedom, and academic institutions <em>collectively.</em></p><p>Therefore, the problem can never be solved by individual responses alone. Here are some resources to consider if you are planning collective defenses with your department, professional organization, or other group. </p><p>The American Association of University Professors (AAUP), informed by years of research and practice, <a href="https://www.aaup.org/news/targeted-online-harassment-faculty#.YU_bI6ApDfY">recommends </a>clear and forceful condemnations of harassment and intimidation from institutions, boards, and faculties, individually and collectively.</p><p><a href="https://facultyfirstresponders.com/responding-as-an-administrator/">How Should Administrators Respond to a Campus Reform Story?</a> I.
